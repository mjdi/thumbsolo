**Thumbsolo: experimental floating drum-typing soft keyboard for Android**

Foray into Android development, and asking the question "is there a better way to type on mobile?"

Created with inspiration/boiler-plate/know-how from a few sources, which I'll list below:

**Build Instructions**
 
 1) Install the latest version of Android Studio on your computer.
 
 2) git clone the repository.
 
 3) Open the repo as a project in Android Studio
 
 4) Click "Build" to create the .apk file (you may need to install the necessary Android SDK 29.0 first), and manually sideload it.
 
 5) Alternatively, open up the Android Emulator, create a new device if needed (or attach your Android smartphone through adb).
 
 6) Once it installs on your device, head to Settings->System->Languages & Input-> and set "ThumbSolo" as your default keyboard.
 
 7) Have fun drumming on currently-too-small key sectors to type :).
 
 **Choice of License**
 
 I ended up choosing the UnLicense because I'm simply standing on the shoulder of giants here;
 this experimental software keyboard for Android is just a way for me to learn Android development.
 Feel free to reuse/modify/extend any parts of this code, in the same spirit as Professor I. Scott MacKenzie from YorkU.
